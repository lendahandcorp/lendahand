                        Project Lend a Hand began from ideas of IT Web Programming students from Nova Scotia Community College in 2023. 
                        It is a project created for the Capstone course. In an educational context, a capstone is a final project or assignment that students undertake to demonstrate their mastery of a subject or a set of skills. 
                        It is typically completed at the end of a degree program, such as a bachelor's or master's degree. 
                        The purpose of a capstone project is to provide students with an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned throughout their degree program to a real-world problem or challenge. Capstone projects often require students to work in teams, to conduct research, and to analyze and synthesize information from multiple sources.
